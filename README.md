# lightbulb-project-omori

In this tribute project I try to recreate the experience of emptiness felt by the player inside "Omori" game, an RPG like game based upon psychological thought.
This is a work in progress, and I am currently using Vue.Js to handle the project itself.
Any sounds, artwork and fonts used in this project DO NOT BELONG TO ME. I just used them for the sake of the project and get the same feeling. 
Shout out to the creators of Omori.
